# Delayyyyyy
## That's six y's
### (I kinda hate that name already)

Delayyyyyy is a simple program made with JUCE framework (v6.0.4). It's basically a delay or a beat repeater, not 100% sure which one exactly.

What it does is that it takes an input signal and copies it to a varying amounts of buffers with varying amounts of delay, causing... the delay effect. User can set the maximum delay, and the rest of the delay buffers have a increasingly small delay within that time period. Also decay time (called feedback in application), ping pong, and wetness parameters are present.

Still working on this to get it into a bit more presentable shape, but it already does what it promises. Following features are still on the to-do list:
- VST support (it may work as a VST plugin, I haven't tried it)
- BPM synced delay
- Use value trees for the parameters
- Custom UI (just because I want to try it out)
- Refactoring & optimizations
- Update JUCE version
